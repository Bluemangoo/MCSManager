/**
 * A circular buffer is an array-based data structure that enables element addition and overwrite operations with O(1) time complexity,
 * making it highly suitable for high-frequency push operations and the need to remove the oldest data.
 * Additionally, its memory usage is fixed and does not grow dynamically,
 * meeting the requirements for high efficiency and low memory consumption.
